 

The HTML <div> tag is used to group the large section of HTML elements together.

We know that every tag has a specific purpose e.g. p tag is used to specify paragraph, <h1> to <h6> tag are used to specify headings but the <div> tag is just like a container unit which is used to encapsulate other page elements and divides the HTML documents into sections.

The div tag is generally used by web developers to group HTML elements together and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For example: If you wrap a set of paragraph elements into a div element so you can take the advantage of CSS styles and apply font style to all paragraphs at once instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element.

<div style="border:1px solid pink;padding:20px;font-size:20px">  
<p>Welcome to CSSCorp  Here you get training  on fullstack technologies.</p>  
<p>This is second paragraph</p>  
</div>  

Difference between HTML div tag and span tag
 
HTML div is a block element.	HTML span is an inline element
HTML div element is used to wrap large sections of elements.	HTML span element is used to wrap small portion of texts, image etc.

HTML Color Styles
 

What do you mean by Colors?
Colors are used to enhance the web pages. The use of different colors schemes makes web pages more attractive.

Following the different color styles can be used to create new colors by combining different colors.

1. Hexadecimal Style:
In this style, we define the color in 6 digit hexadecimal numbers (from 0 to F). It is denoted by '#'.
yntax:

#RRGGBB  
In the above syntax, the first two digits indicate a red color, the next two digits indicate a green color, and the last two digits indicate a blue color.

For example: #ff00ff

In the above example, ff is displayed as red, 00 is displayed as green, and the ff is displayed as blue.
2. RGB Style:
It stands Red, Green, and Blue. In this, the range of each color is from 0 to 255.

RGBA Style:
It stands Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is an extension of RGB style. In this style, the 4th parameter, alpha, indicates the degree of transparency. In this, the range of green, blue and red is from 0 to 255, and the range of alpha is 0 to 1. With this, we can make the color transparent according to desire.

HSL Style:
This style is the image's color.
hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)  
H: In the above syntax, H stands for Hue. The range of hue is 0 to 360. In this range, 0 value is used for red, 120 value is for green, and 240 value is used for blue.
S: In the above syntax, S stands for Saturation. It describes the intensity of the color. In this, 0% is used for a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. 50 % also defines the grey color, but we can still see the color with the use of this.
L: In the above syntax, L stands for Lightness of the color. It defines the color brightness. 0% is used for black, 100% is used for white, and 50% means neither black nor white.

On the HTML document you have often seen that there is a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration before the <html> tag. HTML <!DOCTYPE> tag is used to inform the browser about the version of HTML used in the document. It is called as the document type declaration (DTD).

Technically <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it just an instruction to the browser about the document type. It is a null element which does not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it.

Actually, there are many type of HTML e.g. HTML 4.01 Strict, HTML 4.01 Transitional, HTML 4.01 Frameset, XHTML 1.0 Strict, XHTML 1.0 Transitional, XHTML 1.0 Frameset, XHTML 1.1 etc.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers Document Type Declaration (DTD) in HTML 4.01; because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. But HTML 5 is not SGML based language.

HTML <abbr> tag is used to represent an acronym or abbreviation of a longer word or phrase, such as www, HTML, HTTP, etc. The content written between <abbr> tags renders with dotted underline in some browser.

Although <acronym> tag is not supported by HTML5 but instead of that we can use <abbr> tag and we will get the same result using both tag.
This tag can be used with "title" attribute (optional), and the value of title attribute will be pop-up when the mouse hovers over the content written between <abbr> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
  <head>  
    <title>Abbreviation Tag</title>  
   </head>  
 <body>  
    <h2>Abbreviation tag example</h2>

HTML audio tag is used to define sounds such as music and other audio clips. Currently there are three supported file format for HTML 5 audio tag.

mp3
wav
ogg
HTML5 supports <video> and <audio> controls. The Flash, Silverlight and similar technologies are used to play the multimedia items.

<audio controls>  
  <source src="koyal.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">  
Your browser does not support the html audio tag.  
</audio>  

Attribute	Description

</video>  


The HTML SVG is an acronym which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.

HTML SVG is a modularized language which is used to describe graphics in XML. It describe two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML. It is a W3C recommendation. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. So as XML files, you can create and edit an SVG image with text editor, but generally drawing programs like inkspace are preferred to create it.

SVG is mostly used for vector type diagrams like pie charts, 2-Dimensional graphs in an X,Y coordinate system etc.

The <svg> element specifies the root of a SVG fragment. You can animate every element and every attribute in SVG files

<svg height="210" width="500">  
  <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198"  
  style="fill:red;stroke:yellow;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:nonzero;" />  
</svg>  
Here, we are using points attribute of polygon tag.
 
Why SVG is preferred over other image formats?
SVG images can be saved as the smallest size possible. Unlike bitmap image formats like JPG or PNG, it does not contain a fixed set of dots. So it is also easy to print with high quality at any resolution.

SVG images can be zoomed to a certain level without degradation of the picture quality.

SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files, so they can be created and edited with any text editor.

HTML Canvas Tag
The HTML canvas element provides HTML a bitmapped surface to work with. It is used to draw graphics on the web page.

The HTML 5 <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics using scripting language like JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics, you must need a scripting language to draw the graphics. The <canvas> element allows for dynamic and scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.

It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene. There are several methods in canvas to draw paths, boxes, circles, text and add images.

How to create a HTML canvas?
A canvas is a rectangle like area on an HTML page. It is specified with canvas element. By default, the <canvas> element has no border and no content, it is like a container.
 <canvas id="myCanvas1" width="300" height="100" style="border:2px solid;">  
Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.  
</canvas>  
Note: It is always necessary to specify the id attribute and the height & width attribute to define the size of the canvas. You can have multiple canvas elements on one HTML page.


HTML Drag and Drop
HTML Drag and Drop (DnD) is a feature of HTML5. It is a powerful user interface concept which is used to copy, reorder and delete items with the help of mouse. You can hold the mouse button down over an element and drag it to another location. If you want to drop the element there, just release the mouse button.

If you want to achieve the Drag and Drop functionality in traditional HTML4, you must either have to use complex JavaScript programming or other JavaScript frameworks like jQuery etc.

HTML5 Drag and Drop Example (we will see this when we are doing JS)
 

HTML <bdi> tag
HTML <bdi> tag stands for Bidirectional Isolate Element. It is used to inform the browser to isolate the span of text which may be formatted in opposite directions than the surrounding text.

This tag is new in HTML5 and useful for languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, or if the browser dynamically inserts some text without knowing the directionality of text.

Note: The directionality of content inside <bdi> does not influence by the directionality of surrounding content.
Syntax
<bdi>Content</bdi>  


Difference between <bdi> and <bdo>
HTML <bdi> tag is new element of HTML5 and it is very similar to HTML <bdo> element. But the main difference in both the elements is that <bdi> tag isolates the content from its surrounding content but <bdo> tag reveres the direction. Sometimes <bdo> tag may cause some unexpected rendering errors so try to use <bdi> if required.

HTML <ruby> tag
HTML <ruby> tag is used to represent ruby annotations on the web page. Ruby annotations are useful if we want to show the pronunciation of East Asian characters like Chinese and Japanese Chinese.

The <ruby> tag enclosed one or more <rt> elements which give the pronunciation of ruby annotations and displays above the annotation characters. It can also contain <rp> (optional) element which is used as a fall-back parenthesis for the browser which does not support the ruby annotation.

HTML <ruby> tag can also be used to represent small annotation which is relevant to the main content, apart from East Asian language.

The <ruby> tag is new in HTML5.
<!DOCTYPE html>
